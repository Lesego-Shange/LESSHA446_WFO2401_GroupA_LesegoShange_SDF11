After providing the user with information on the value of the product, they are asked to take action as the website is a marketing tool.
- Detail the creation of the hero section using Tailwind CSS for styling and grid layout for alignment.
The <section> element is used to define a section of content, and it's styled as a grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes. It spans the full width of the container (w-full) and contains two columns on medium screens and above (md:grid-cols-2). There's also a gap between columns defined for different screen sizes.

Inside the section, there are two main components: the left column (Text Column) and the right column (Image).

The left column contains text content such as the title, description, and buttons. It is flexibly aligned in the center for small screens and starts from the left for larger screens (lg:text-start). The content is vertically aligned using flex utilities.

The right column contains an image, and it is hidden (hidden) on small screens and only displayed starting from medium screens (md:flex). The image is responsive and occupies 4/5 of the available width (w-4/5) and has rounded corners (rounded-md).

Each component is styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring responsiveness and consistency across different screen sizes.

Overall, this hero section provides a visually appealing layout with clear text content and an accompanying image, ensuring a compelling presentation of the featured product or service.
